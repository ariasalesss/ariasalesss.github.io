    <h3 id="Etymology"> Etymology</h3>
        <p>Names for the species include the common raccoon,[6] North American raccoon,[7] and northern raccoon.[8] In various North American native languages, the reference to the animal's manual dexterity, or use of its hands is the source for the names.[9] The word raccoon was adopted into English from the native Powhatan term meaning 'animal that scratches with its hands', as used in the Colony of Virginia. It was recorded on John Smith's list of Powhatan words as aroughcun, and on that of William Strachey as arathkone.[10] It has also been identified as a reflex of a Proto-Algonquian root *ahrah-koon-em, meaning '[the] one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands'.[11] The word is sometimes spelled as racoon.[12]
        In Spanish, the raccoon is called mapache, derived from the Nahuatl mapachtli of the Aztecs, meaning '[the] one who takes everything in its hands'.[13]
        Its Latin name literally means 'before-dog washer'.[14] The genus Procyon was named by Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr.[9] The animal's observed habit of "washing" or "dowsing" (see below) is the source of its name in other languages.[15][16] For example, the French "raton laveur" means "washing rat".</p>

    <h3 id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</h3>
            <p>In the first decades after its discovery by the members of the expedition of Christopher Columbus, who were the first Europeans to leave a written record about the species, taxonomists thought the raccoon was related to many different species, including dogs, cats, badgers and particularly bears.[22] Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus Ursus, first as Ursus cauda elongata ('long-tailed bear') in the second edition of his Systema Naturae (1740), then as Ursus Lotor ('washer bear') in the tenth edition (1758-59).[23][24] In 1780, Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr placed the raccoon in its own genus Procyon, which can be translated as either 'before the dog' or 'doglike'.[25][26] It is also possible that Storr had its nocturnal lifestyle in mind and chose the star Procyon as eponym for the species.[27][28]</p>
        <p> <strong>Evolution</strong></p>
            <p>Based on fossil evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of the family Procyonidae lived in Europe in the late Oligocene about 25 million years ago.[29] Similar tooth and skull structures suggest procyonids and weasels share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears.[30] After the then-existing species crossed the Bering Strait at least six million years later in the early Miocene, the center of its distribution was probably in Central America.[31] Coatis (Nasua and Nasuella) and raccoons (Procyon) have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus Paranasua present between 5.2 and 6.0 million years ago.[32] This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to ringtails.[33] Unlike other procyonids, such as the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), the ancestors of the common raccoon left tropical and subtropical areas and migrated farther north about 2.5 million years ago, in a migration that has been confirmed by the discovery of fossils in the Great Plains dating back to the middle of the Pliocene.[34][32] Its most recent ancestor was likely Procyon rexroadensis, a large Blancan raccoon from the Rexroad Formation characterized by its narrow back teeth and large lower jaw.[35]</p>
        


    <h3 id="Description"> Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></p>
            <p>Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between 40 and 70 cm (16 and 28 in), not including the bushy tail which can measure between 20 and 40 cm (7.9 and 15.7 in), but is usually not much longer than 25 cm (9.8 in).[70][71][72] The shoulder height is between 23 and 30 cm (9.1 and 11.8 in).[73] The body weight of an adult raccoon varies considerably with habitat, making the raccoon one of the most variably sized mammals. It can range from 2 to 26 kg (4.4 to 57.3 lb), but is usually between 5 and 12 kg (11 and 26 lb). The smallest specimens live in southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see Bergmann's rule).[74] Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier than females.[75] At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage.[76][77][78] The largest recorded wild raccoon weighed 28.4 kg (63 lb) and measured 140 cm (55 in) in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.[79][80]
            The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black fur around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a "bandit's mask" and has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief.[81][82] The slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur. Raccoons are assumed to recognize the facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly because of the conspicuous facial coloration and the alternating light and dark rings on the tail.[83][84][85] The dark mask may also reduce glare and thus enhance night vision.[84][85] On other parts of the body, the long and stiff guard hairs, which shed moisture, are usually colored in shades of gray and, to a lesser extent, brown.[86] Raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in the German population because individuals with such coloring were among those initially released to the wild.[87] The dense underfur, which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates against cold weather and is composed of 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.18 in) long hairs.[86]
            The raccoon, whose method of locomotion is usually considered to be plantigrade, can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws.[88][89] As raccoons have short legs compared to their compact torso, they are usually not able either to run quickly or jump great distances.[90][91] Their top speed over short distances is 16 to 24 km/h (9.9 to 14.9 mph).[92][93] Raccoons can swim with an average speed of about 5 km/h (3.1 mph) and can stay in the water for several hours.[94][91] For climbing down a tree headfirst—an unusual ability for a mammal of its size—a raccoon rotates its hind feet so they are pointing backwards.[95][91] Raccoons have a dual cooling system to regulate their temperature; that is, they are able to both sweat and pant for heat dissipation.[96][97]
            Raccoon skulls have a short and wide facial region and a voluminous braincase. </p>
       

    <h3 id="Behavior"> Behavior</h3>
        <p><strong>Social Behavior</strong></p>
            <p>Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and Ulf Hohmann suggest that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behaviors and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought.[132][133] Related females often live in a so-called "fission-fusion society"; that is, they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding or resting grounds.[134][135] Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain their position against foreign males during the mating season—or against other potential invaders.[136] Such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.[137][138] Since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves.[139]
                With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their social structure a "three-class society".[140] Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of zoology at Weber State University and author of the book Raccoons: A Natural History, is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in North Dakota in 1978, males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.[141]
                The shape and size of a raccoon's home range varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles.[142] While the size of home ranges in the habitat of North Dakota's prairies lie between 7 and 50 km2 (3 and 20 sq mi) for males and between 2 and 16 km2 (1 and 6 sq mi) for females, the average size in a marsh at Lake Erie was 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi).[143] Irrespective of whether the home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season if food supplies are sufficient.[144] Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and identify individuals.[123] Urine and feces left at shared raccoon latrines may provide additional information about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and playing.[145]
                Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that "typically you'll find 10 to 15 percent that will do the opposite" of what is expected.[146]</p>
        
       

    <h3 id="Range"> Range</h3>
        <p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>
            <p>Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb when they feel threatened.[228][229] Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of beech trees, as beech bark is too smooth to climb.[230] Tree hollows in old oaks or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons use burrows dug by other mammals, dense undergrowth or tree crotches.[231][232] In a study in the Solling range of hills in Germany, more than 60% of all sleeping places were used only once, but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70% of all uses.[233] Since amphibians, crustaceans, and other animals around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the raccoon diet, lowland deciduous or mixed forests abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest population densities.[234][235] While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer (1.3 to 8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed 6 animals per square kilometer (15.5 animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilometer (51.8 animals per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes. /p>
        <p><strong>Urban Raccoons</strong></p>
            <p>Due to its adaptability, the raccoon has been able to use urban areas as a habitat. The first sightings were recorded in a suburb of Cincinnati in the 1920s. Since the 1950s, raccoons have been present in metropolitan areas like Washington, DC, Chicago, Toronto, and New York City.[270][271] Since the 1960s, Kassel has hosted Europe's first and densest population in a large urban area, with about 50 to 150 animals per square kilometer (130 to 390 animals per square mile), a figure comparable to those of urban habitats in North America.[270][272] Home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 3 to 40 hectares (7.5 to 100 acres) for females and 8 to 80 hectares (20 to 200 acres) for males.[273] In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement area.[270][274] Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers in municipal waste are easily available food sources.[275] Furthermore, a large number of additional sleeping areas exist in these areas, such as hollows in old garden trees, cottages, garages, abandoned houses, and attics. The percentage of urban raccoons sleeping in abandoned or occupied houses varies from 15% in Washington, DC (1991) to 43% in Kassel (2003).</p>

    <h3 id="Health"> Health</h3>
        <p>Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s.[276] Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons.[277] The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations.[278][279][280] Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies".[281] Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness.[282] There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead.[87][262][282] Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department.[283][284] Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.</p>
        <p>Unlike rabies and at least a dozen other pathogens carried by raccoons, distemper, an epizootic virus, does not affect humans.[285][286] This disease is the most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population and affects individuals of all age groups.[205] For example, 94 of 145 raccoons died during an outbreak in Clifton, Ohio, in 1968.[287] It may occur along with a following inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), causing the animal to display rabies-like symptoms.[276] In Germany, the first eight cases of distemper were reported in 2007.</p>

        <p><strong>Conflicts</strong></p>
            <p>Raccoons have become notorious in urban areas for consuming food waste. They possess impressive problem-solving abilities and can break into all but the most secure food waste bins, which has earned them the derisive nickname trash panda.[293] The presence of raccoons in close proximity to humans may be undesirable, as raccoon droppings (like most wild animals) contain parasites and other disease vectors. Raccoon roundworm is of particular concern to public health. It can be contracted in humans by accidental ingestion or inhalation of the eggs, which are present in the feces of infected raccoons. While usually harmless to the host, it causes progressive neurological damage in humans, and is eventually fatal if untreated. It is found in about 60% of adult raccoons. The general presence of raccoons in an area is not typically of concern, but nests or droppings found within or near structures should be destroyed. Roundworm eggs are very robust and bleach alone is insufficient; burning or treatment with hot solutions of sodium hydroxide is required. The keeping of raccoons as pets is illegal in some jurisdictions due to these risks.[294][295] The increasing number of raccoons in urban areas has resulted in diverse reactions in humans, ranging from outrage at their presence to deliberate feeding.[296] Some wildlife experts and most public authorities caution against feeding wild animals because they might become increasingly obtrusive and dependent on humans as a food source.[297] Other experts challenge such arguments and give advice on feeding raccoons and other wildlife in their books.[298][299] Raccoons without a fear of humans are a concern to those who attribute this trait to rabies, but scientists point out this behavior is much more likely to be a behavioral adjustment to living in habitats with regular contact to humans for many generations.[262][300] Raccoons usually do not prey on domestic cats and dogs, but isolated cases of killings have been reported.[301] Attacks on pets may also target their owners</p>
        <p><strong>Mythology, Arts, and Entertainment</strong></p>
            <p>In the mythology of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the raccoon is the subject of folk tales.[312] Stories such as "How raccoons catch so many crayfish" from the Tuscarora centered on its skills at foraging.[313] In other tales, the raccoon played the role of the trickster which outsmarts other animals, like coyotes and wolves.[314] Among others, the Dakota believe the raccoon has natural spirit powers, since its mask resembles the facial paintings, two-fingered swashes of black and white, used during rituals to connect to spirit beings.[315] The Aztecs linked supernatural abilities especially to females, whose commitment to their young was associated with the role of wise women in their society. The raccoon also appears in Native American art across a wide geographic range. Petroglyphs with engraved raccoon tracks were found in Lewis Canyon, Texas;[317] at the Crow Hollow petroglyph site in Grayson County, Kentucky;[318] and in river drainages near Tularosa, the San Francisco River of New Mexico and Arizona.[319] The meaning and significance of the Raccoon Priests Gorget, which features a stylized carving of a raccoon and was found at the Spiro Mounds, Oklahoma, remains unknown.</p>
